🧗‍♂️ Portfolio — Climbing Through My Projects

Welcome to my personal portfolio website. This project is both a showcase of my work and a creative experiment in interaction design. Instead of a traditional scrolling portfolio, I wanted to capture something that feels more personal and unique to me.

🎯 Concept

The site is designed around a bouldering wall. The background image is a photo of me facing a climbing wall, and each hold on the wall represents a project I’ve worked on.

Hover Interactions: when the user hovers over a hold, the mouse changes to a “grabbing” hand.

Popups: selecting a hold reveals a floating popup with project details (screenshots, descriptions, links).

Color Coding: just like climbing routes, holds are color coded to represent categories of projects.

Progression: visitors “climb” through my portfolio, moving from hold to hold to discover my work.

About Me: hovering over my back in the image reveals personal information and background.

This creates a playful, exploratory way to navigate my projects while connecting to one of my real-life passions: climbing.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Framework: Astro
 (static-first, fast, modern)

Language: TypeScript

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Interactive Components: React Islands (for hover effects, popups, etc.)

Astro lets me keep the site lightweight and fast, only loading JavaScript where it’s needed.

📂 Content

Projects showcased on the site include:

Figma prototypes

Web applications built over the past two years

Personal experiments and coursework highlights

Each project is represented visually and linked for deeper exploration.

🚀 Deployment

The portfolio will be deployed using Vercel
 for free, reliable hosting with automatic SSL. A custom domain may later be connected via simply.com, where I have access to student discounts.

📱 Future Work

Mobile-friendly layout and navigation (to be added later).

Accessibility improvements (keyboard navigation, screen-reader support).

More animations and polish once the base interactions are complete.

✨ Thanks for visiting!
This project is as much about how I present my work as it is about the projects themselves — climbing my way through code, design, and creativity.
